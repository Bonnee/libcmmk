An unofficial implementation of the Masterkey Lighting API that can be used
to programmatically control LEDs of Coolermaster Masterkey keyboards.

Based entirely on captured USB data without any reverse engineering performed
on official binaries.

Due to a lack of hardware available for testing, the only currently supported
model is the EU / German version of the Masterkeys L edition.


Requirements:
  - A C compiler from at least the current century (C99)
  - libusb-1.0
